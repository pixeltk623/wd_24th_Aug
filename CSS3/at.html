CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

Mouse over the element below to see a CSS transition effect:

transition
transition-delay
transition-duration
transition-property
transition-timing-function 

Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition
The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used:

#div1 {transition-timing-function: linear;}
#div2 {transition-timing-function: ease;}
#div3 {transition-timing-function: ease-in;}
#div4 {transition-timing-function: ease-out;}
#div5 {transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;}

Delay the Transition Effect
The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.

The following example has a 1 second delay before starting:

div {
 	transition: width 3s;
  	transition-delay: 1s;
}


Transition + Transformation
The following example adds a transition effect to the transformation:

transition: width 2s, height 2s, transform 2s;

transform: rotate(180deg);



transition-property: width;
transition-duration: 2s;
transition-timing-function: linear;
transition-delay: 1s;

or by using the shorthand property transition:

transition: width 2s linear 1s;



CSS Animations

CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

@keyframes
animation-name
animation-duration
animation-delay
animation-iteration-count
animation-direction
animation-timing-function
animation-fill-mode
animation



What are CSS Animations?
An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.

To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

The @keyframes Rule
When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.

The following example binds the "example" animation to the <div> element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the background-color of the <div> element from "red" to "yellow":


div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}

@keyframes example {
  from {background-color: red;}
  to {background-color: yellow;}
}


/* The animation code */
@keyframes example {
  0%   {background-color: red;}
  25%  {background-color: yellow;}
  50%  {background-color: blue;}
  100% {background-color: green;}
}

/* The element to apply the animation to */
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}


@keyframes example {
  0%   {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
  25%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:0px;}
  50%  {background-color:blue; left:200px; top:200px;}
  75%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:200px;}
  100% {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
}

/* The element to apply the animation to */
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}

Delay an Animation
The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.

The following example has a 2 seconds delay before starting the animation:

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-delay: 2s;
}


Set How Many Times an Animation Should Run
The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.

The following example will run the animation 3 times before it stops:

animation-iteration-count: 3;
animation-iteration-count: infinite;

Run Animation in Reverse Direction or Alternate Cycles
The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.

The animation-direction property can have the following values:

normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards
The following example will run the animation in reverse direction (backwards):

Specify the Speed Curve of the Animation
The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.

The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used:


#div1 {animation-timing-function: linear;}
#div2 {animation-timing-function: ease;}
#div3 {animation-timing-function: ease-in;}
#div4 {animation-timing-function: ease-out;}
#div5 {animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;}
